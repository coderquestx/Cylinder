# 3D Cylinder with Cone in Python

This project demonstrates how to create and visualize a 3D model of a **cylinder** with a **cone** on top using Python. The model is generated using the `matplotlib` library and its `mplot3d` toolkit, which allows for simple 3D plotting. This example is aimed at learning basic 3D rendering concepts in Python.

## Features

- **Cylinder & Cone Model**: Create a 3D model combining a cylinder and a cone.
- **3D Plotting**: Use `matplotlib` to render and display the 3D model.
- **Educational Tool**: Learn how to visualize 3D shapes and objects in Python.
- **No External Libraries**: Only Python's `matplotlib` and `numpy` are required.
